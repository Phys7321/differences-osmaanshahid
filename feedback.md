Can you one more thing for the first assignment - include the execution syntax in you python folder - maybe in a ipynb file or a separate .nb file. 
The code looks good, I just want you to get use to writing the code that executes your work.

Why don't you stop by my office some time, I'm still confused about what you are doing in your python code. I want to understand your thought processes.
